SubImgCharMatcher Class Implementation:
In our implementation of the SubImgCharMatcher class, we used different data structures to optimize the
performance of character matching in sub-images.
1. charSet: We used a TreeSet to store the characters given in the constructor. The TreeSet provides O(log n)
time complexity for insertion and lookup operations, which is efficient for our needs. It also maintains the
characters in sorted order, which is helpful when looking for the smallest character with brightness closest
to a given subImage brightness.
2. charNotNormalizedBrightnessMap: We used a HashMap to map each character to its corresponding raw brightness
value. The HashMap provides O(1) average time complexity for lookups, which is crucial for quickly retrieving
the brightness of a character during the matching process. The not normalized brightness values are calculated
once and stored in this map so that if the minimum or maximum brightness values change, we can easily
recompute the normalized values without recalculating the raw brightness for each character.
3. charNormalizedBrightnessMap: Similar to the previous map, we used another HashMap to store the normalized
brightness values for each character. This allows for quick access to the already calculated normalized
brightness values when the char set isn't changed between different runs of the matcher.

image Package Implementation:
In our implementation of the image package, we added the several classes in order to handle image processing
while keeping the code modular and implementing the single responsibility principle.:
1. ImagePadder: This class handles padding images to ensure their dimensions are a power of two.
2. ImageDivider: This class is responsible for dividing an image into smaller sub-images based on specified
dimensions.
3. SubImage: This class represents a sub-image that has been created through the ImageDivider. It contains
information about the sub-image's brightness to facilitate character matching without redundant calculations.

AsciiArtAlgorithm Class Implementation:
In our implementation of the AsciiArtAlgorithm class, we created a constructor that gets a SunImgCharMatcher,
an ArrayList of SubImages, the resolution of the output image and a boolean indicating whether to use reverse
mode or not. Using these parameters continues the approach of using the values we've already calculated for
previous runs.
